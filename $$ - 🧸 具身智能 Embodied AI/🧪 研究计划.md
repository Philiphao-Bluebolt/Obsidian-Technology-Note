## My Research Interest

I always believe that the intergration of robotics and AI is the trend for the two related frontier field. That's my motivation to explore the concept of embodied AI. 

Nowaday, the population aging is becoming a worldwide problem, leading to social issues like labour shortage and high demand for elderly caring service. My long-term goal is to develop multi-task robots that are capable of doing all kinds of houseworks and providing emotional support for the family members, especially elderly people.

To achieve the aforementioned goal, the designed robot should have the following functions or structures:

+ **Vision Semantic Understanding**: the ability to see and understand the surrounding objects
+ **Tactile Sensing**: the ability to feel the pressure and friction on the contact surface
+ **Smooth Locomotion**: the ability to perform smooth gaits and graping actions
+ **Soft Structure**: at least the part where the robot makes contact with human should be soft
