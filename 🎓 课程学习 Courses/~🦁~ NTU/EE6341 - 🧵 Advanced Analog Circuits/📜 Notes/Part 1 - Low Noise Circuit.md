## Noise in the circuit

+ **Cause** - Unavoidable fluctuations of voltage and current in components
+ **Characteristics** - Random, Unpredictable, Indeterministic
+ Noise Floor - Sensitivity of a system

High Noise Floor results in inability to distinguish signal and noise

## How to describe a Noise

> Random process against a random signal.

+ Probability Density Function (PDF) - Time Domain Characteristics 
+ Power Spectral Density (PSD) - Frequency Domain Characteristics

In a electrical circuit, a noise emerges in the form of voltage or current, but we're more interested in the power it produces rather than its own value. The definition of power and energy of a signal in signal processing is slightly different from their counterpart in physics as **the load is ignored**.

The square of the value of a noise $x(t)$ is equal to the power in quantity.

+ Noise Power (MS Intensity) - The average **power** (square of signal intensity) of a noise $x(t)$ over a long period of time
$$\overline{X^2}=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T x^2(t)dt$$
+ RMS - The root of Noise Power, a common representation for electric signal (Unit: $V$ or $A$)
$$X_{rms}=\sqrt{\overline{X^2}}=\sqrt{\overline{x^2}\Delta f}$$
+ Power Spectral Density (PSD) - A function of frequency (Unit: $V^2/Hz$ or $A^2/Hz$)
$$\overline{x^2}=\frac{\overline{X^2}}{\Delta f}$$
$\Delta f$ is the equivalent noise bandwidth of the system

---
## Equivalent Noise Bandwidth

Equivalent Noise Bandwidth $\Delta f$ defines a ideal retangular window filter with a gain equal to the original system mid-frequency gain $A_0$. The total power of this ideal retangular window filter is the same as the original system
$$\begin{align}{A_0}^2\Delta f&=\int_0^\infty |H(jf)|^2df\\
\Delta f&=\frac{\int_0^\infty |H(jf)|^2df}{{A_0}^2}\end{align}$$

This conception is to simplify the calculation of output RMS voltage.

## Types of Noise

Noises in a circuit result from different physical property.

| Noise Type                                  | Related Component                    | Cause                                | Condition of Present                  | PSD (Power Spectral Density)                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Shot** noise                              | PN Junction (Inside Diode, BJT, MOS) | Electron crosses a potential barrier | DC biasing current exists             | $$\overline{i^2}=2qI$$                                          |
| **Burst** noise (Popcorn noise)             | Dicrete Transistors                  | Heavy-metal ion<br>contamination     | DC biasing current exists             | $$\overline{i^2}=k_2\frac{I^b}{1+(f/f_c)^2}$$                   |

## Noise Source Transform

Similar to regular signal source, noise source can be combined together using basic principles. The direction of the noise source is not important as the noise is completely random.

### Combination (Sum of Square Rule)

Different noise sources in a circuit are uncorrelated, therefore the noise signals can be summed. The combination formula of the noise PSD:
$$\begin{align}\overline{x^2}=\overline{(x_1+x_2)^2}&=\overline{x_1^2}+\overline{x_2^2}+2\overline{x_1 x_2}\\
&=\overline{x_1^2}+\overline{x_2^2}\end{align}$$
Combination can be done between **serial voltage noise sources** and **parallel current noise sources**

### Transform

Noise generated from a resistor can be transformed between voltage form and current form using the source transform theorem.

## Noise model of Diode

The noise of a diode has two parts, the thermal noise is produced by the resistance of the silicon and the other is due to the PN junction noise.

+ Silicon Resistance $r_s$ (equivalent to a physical resistor) - **Thermal** Noise
$$\overline{v_s^2}=4kTr_s$$
+ PN Junction - **Shot** + **Flicker** + **Burst** Noise (Burst Noise usually neglected)
$$\overline{i^2}=2qI_D+k1(\frac{I_D^a}{f})+k_2\frac{I_D^b}{1+(f/f_c)^2}$$
![[Pasted image 20240820153609.png]]

---
## Noise model of BJT

The BJT noise model is based on the **simplified** version of Hybrid Pi model with capacitance $C_\mu$ and resistance $r_{ce}$ ignored. When a BJT works, there exists three parts of noise. 

+ Base Region Material Resistor $r_b$ - **Thermal** Noise
$$\overline{v_b^2}=4kTr_b$$
+ Emitter PN Junction - **Shot** + **Flicker** + **Burst** Noise (Burst Noise usually neglected)
$$\overline{i^2_b}=2qI_B+k_1\frac{I_B^a}{f}+k_2\frac{I_B^b}{1+(f/f_c)^2}$$
+ Collector Output - **Shot** Noise
$$\overline{i_c^2}=2qI_C$$

## Noise model of FET

The noise model of FET is much simplier than the noise model of BJT since the gate-source current is neglectable. FET noise consists of two parts.

+ Gate-source noise current $\overline{i^2_g}$ - **Shot** noise (Usually **ignorable** since $I_G \approx 0$)
$$\overline{i^2_g}=2qI_G$$
+ Drain-source noise current $\overline{i^2_d}$ - **Thermal** (Channel Resistance) +  **Flicker** noise
$$\overline{i^2_d}=4kT\frac{2}{3}g_m+K\frac{I_D}{f}$$

## Noise model of Op Amp

The noises of a Op Amp situates at the input circuit and consists of three parts. 

+ Invert input noise current $\overline{i^2_n}$
+ Non-invert input noise current $\overline{i^2_n}$
+ Non-invert input noise voltage $\overline{e^2_n}$

Owing to the flicker noises inside the Op Amp, $\overline{i^2_n}$ and $\overline{e^2_n}$  are not constants. They are functions of frequency and can be calculated as
$$\overline{e^2_n}=\overline{e^2_{nw}}(\frac{f_{ce}}{f}+1)$$
$$\overline{i^2_n}=\overline{i^2_{nw}}(\frac{f_{ci}}{f}+1)$$

## Equivalent Input Noise

+ **Goal** - Simplify noise analysis
+ **Based on** - Two port network equivalent theory

A noisy network can be seperated into a noiseless network and a network of noise sources which produces the same output noise PSD as the original noise sources.
$$\begin{align}\overline{v^2_o}&=|H_1(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{o1}}+|H_2(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{o2}}+|H_3(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{o3}}+...+|H_n(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{on}}\\&=|H(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_i}\end{align}$$
![[Pasted image 20240904144556.png]]

Usually, we use **two noise sources**, a serial voltage source $\overline{v^2_i}$ and a parallel current source $\overline{i^2_i}$ , instead of one, to describe the equivalent noise. The reason for using two equivalent sources is because the usage of one source **can not fully represent all the noise characteristics** inside the network, as shown in the two-port network theory.
![[Pasted image 20240914222234.png]]

If we only use a input voltage source to represent the internal noise, then the equivalent source won't work if the previous circuit of the network is open circuit. 

### Calculation

The Calculation of Equivalent Input Noise consists of two steps. It mainly uses the superposition principle.

+ Calculate equivalent noise **voltage** source --> short-circuit input to remove the response of the current part.

$$|H(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_i}=|H_1(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{o1}}+|H_2(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{o2}}+|H_3(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{o3}}+...+|H_n(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{on}}$$
![[Pasted image 20240914222313.png]]

+ Calculate equivalent noise **current** source --> open-cricuit input to remove the response of the voltage part.

$$|H(jf)'|^2\overline{i^2_i}=|H_1(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{o1}}+|H_2(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{o2}}+|H_3(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{o3}}+...+|H_n(jf)|^2\overline{v^2_{on}}$$

![[Pasted image 20240914223052.png]]

The combination of two responses by the two equivalent input sources is the equivalent input noise of the noisy network.

### Equivalent Input Noise of semiconductor models

The calculation process is shown in the examples note. The noise of load resistance is not included.

#### BJT Equivalent Input Noise

#### FET Equivalent Input Noise


#### Op Amp (Feedback Amplifier Circuit) 

$$\overline{e^2_{ni}}=\overline{e_n^2}+\overline{i_n^2}(R_p^2+R_n^2)+4kT(R_p+R_n)$$

(Non-inverting input node and $R_p=R_3//R_4$ , $R_n=R_1//R_2$)

## Noise Factor

+ **Goal** - Measure the noise performance of a device, compared it to a noise-free one
+ **Signal-Noise Ratio** - Power ratio in dB
$$SNR=10\log\frac{V^2_{signal}}{V_{noise}^2}=20\log\frac{V_{signal}}{V_{noise}}$$

+ **Noise factor** is a metric describing the noise performance of a network. It's the ratio of input and output SNR (in fraction form) of the network
$$F=\frac{SNR_i}{SNR_o}=\frac{S_i/N_i}{S_o/N_o}$$
+ **Noise Figure** is the Noise Factor in dB form
$$NF=10\log F$$

Notice that Noise Factor is **not** an intrinsic property of a network since it depends on input noise. If you change the input, the noise factor will change.

### Intuitive Noise Power Form

Noise Factor can be written in a more intuitive form in which $G$ is the power gain of the circuit.
$$F=\frac{S_i/N_i}{S_o/N_o}=\frac{S_i}{N_i}\cdot\frac{N_o}{S_o}=\frac{N_o}{GN_i}=\frac{GN_i+N'}{GN_i}=1+\frac{N'}{GN_i}$$
The output noise $N_o$ actually consists of two parts

+ $GN_i$ is the power of noise produced by the previous network and amplifiered by this network.
+ $N'$ is the power of noise produced by the network.

As a result, the noise factor of a noiseless network is always 1

### Transformer Coupling

Transformer is usually installed between the input source and the amplifier circuit to transform the input source internal resistance $R_S$ for a minimum noise factor.
