## 2-1  Diode circuit noise analysis

Assume that $V_D = 0.60V$. Boltzmann's constant $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}J/K$, $q = 1.6\times10^{-19} C$ and $T = 300K$.

+ (a) Calculate the mean-squared noise-voltage spectral density in $V^2/Hz$ at $v_o$ for the circuit and then calculate the RMS noise voltage in a $100 kHz$ equivalent noise bandwidth. Neglect capacitive effects, flicker noise and series resistance in the diode.

+ (b) If a $1000 pF$ capacitor is now connected across the diode, including flicker noise, calculate and plot the output mean-Â­squared noise voltage spectral density at $v_o$ in $V^2/Hz$ on log scales from $f = 1Hz$ to $f =10 MHz$. Flicker noise spectral density $= 3 \times 10^{-16}(I_D/f) A^2/Hz$.

First, we draw the equivalent noise circuit without the diode serial resistance and its noise.

The total noise PSD can be computed by the following equation, however we don't know the equivalent resistance $r_d$ and DC current $I_D$ of the diode.
$$\begin{align}\overline{v^2_o}&=(r_d\parallel R)^2(\overline{i^2_R}+\overline{i^2})\\&=(\frac{r_d R}{r_d + R})^2(\frac{4kT}{R}+2qI_D)\end{align}$$
Now calculate $I_D$ and $r_d$. As we know that the voltage drop of silicon diode $V_D=0.6V$, the DC current flowing through the circuit is
$$I_D=\frac{10V-0.6V}{20k\Omega}=0.47mA$$
The equivalent resistance $r_d$ is not fixed but is stable when the DC current is fixed
$$r_d=\frac{kT}{qI_D}=55.05\Omega$$
Now we can calculate $\overline{v^2_o}$
$$\overline{v^2_o}=4.558\times10^{-19}\quad V^2/Hz$$
The RMS noise voltage is
$$V_{rms}=\sqrt{\overline{v^2_o}\Delta f}=0.21\mu V$$

Now we consider the effect of the flicker noise and the extra capacitor.

The new capacitor doesn't affect the DC current of the circuit, but it change the equation of the output noise PSD
$$\begin{align}\overline{v^2_o}&=(r_d\parallel R\parallel C)^2(\overline{i^2_R}+\overline{i^2})\\&=|\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R}+\frac{1}{r_d}+j2\pi fC}|^2(\frac{4kT}{R}+2qI_D+k_1\frac{I_D^a}{f})\\&=\frac{R^2r_d^2}{r_d^2+2r_dR+R^2+4\pi ^2C^2R^2 r_d^2f^2} (1.51\times10^{-22}+\frac{1.41\times10^{-19}}{f})\\&=\frac{1.21\times10^{12}}{4.02\times10^8+4.79\times10^{-5}f^2}(1.51\times10^{-22}+\frac{1.41\times10^{-19}}{f})\end{align}$$

The frequency response of $\overline{v_o^2}$ has two cutoff frequency $f_1, f_2$, the following equations show how they're calculated.
$$\begin{align}1.51\times10^{-22}&=\frac{1.41\times10^{-19}}{f_2}\\f_1&=933.77Hz\end{align}$$
$$\begin{align}4.79\times10^{-5}f_1^2&=4.02\times10^8\\f_2&=2.897MHz\end{align}$$

Now draw the approximate bode plot, the lowest frequency in the graph could be $1Hz$
$$\overline{v^2_o}|_{f=1Hz}=4.2\times10^{-16} V^2/Hz$$

## 2-2  BJT circuit noise analysis

The amplifier circuit has a $-3dB$ bandwidth of $10 kHz$ (single-pole response).
Boltzmann's constant $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-2}J/K$, $q = 1.6\times10^{-19} C$ and $T = 300K$. 
BJT parameters $\beta=150$, $r_{bb'}=60\Omega$.
Ignore flicker noise and the thermal noise of the load resistance.

+ (a) Determine the value of $V_S$ so that $SNR = 0 dB$.
+ (b) Show that if a BJT is driven from a signal source with a source resistance Rs, the value of biasing collector current for maximum sensitivity is given by the following expression.
+ (c) Determine the value of biasing $I_c$ for max $SNR$ and obtain $V_S$ for $SNR = 0 dB$ under the new biasing condition.
