## State Space

State Space is the mathematical representation all the possible state of the problem/system. We need to build up state space representation of the real world problem before we develop algorithm to solve it.

It takes the form of matrix, graph, tuple, tree or any other data structures.

## Exhaustic VS Heuristic

Exhaustic search means to search all the possible state.

Heuristic search is a smart version of exhaustic search. It uses the acquired knowledge to adjust the searching sequence. More possible state will be searched first.
