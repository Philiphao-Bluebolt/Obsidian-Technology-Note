## Question 2

### (a) SVM - Classifier Calculation


### (b) RBF - Center Selection

Methods for center selection of RBF including 

+ Random selection from training samples
	+ Pros - simple and fast
	+ Cons - can not fully represent the data with a small number of neurons
+ Using clustering Prototypes of training samples
	+ Pros - 
	+ Cons - complex because clustering preprocessing is required
+ Feature Selection
	+ Pros -
	+ Cons - 

### (c) MLP - Shallow instead of Deep Architecture?

+ Less
