+ **Aim** - Replace analogue control devices such as RCL compoments and mechanical components
+ **Challenges** - Computer only process discrete data, analog-Digital converters needed

## Signals 

**What it is** - Signal is a function of time (or maybe space)
$$y=f(x)$$
$x$ - time
$y$ - amplitude


**Sorting** - Signal can be sorted by the type of its variables

+ **Continuous** variables can be any value
+ **Discrete** variables are restricted to some value
	+ Discrete time are **sampled**
	+ Discrete amplitude are **quantized**
