Video generation is a challenging task that requires careful consideration of both spatial and temporal consistency. Over the past few years, several neural network architectures have been developed for this purpose, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), First Order Motion Models (FOMM), diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. The selection of a suitable architecture should be based on the specific requirements of the task.

In the case of generating fake videos of Donald Trump, both the input and output formats must be carefully considered. The output may range from a simple talking-head video with a static background to a complex scene involving full-body motion and dynamic environments. The input could be either a text prompt or an image. In this discussion, we assume the model takes a text prompt as input and generates a complex video scenario based on it.

For this task, I propose using the Two-Stream Variational Adversarial Network (TwoStreamVAN) due to its balance between high performance and relatively low computational demands compared to transformer- or diffusion-based models. TwoStreamVAN introduces an innovative design by separating content and motion generation into two parallel streams and integrating them using a multi-scale motion fusion mechanism. This architecture significantly improves classification accuracy on test datasets compared to baseline models such as MoCoGAN and SGVAN.

The TwoStreamVAN architecture is primarily based on GANs and autoencoders. It encodes the content and motion of a video frame—represented by the frame itself and its temporal difference—into two separate latent spaces. Samples drawn from these latent spaces are fed into a generator, which produces the content and motion of the next frame. Finally, two discriminators are used: one evaluates the realism of individual frames, while the other assesses the coherence and authenticity of the generated video clip as a whole.

Although publicly available video datasets featuring Donald Trump are limited, a dataset can be constructed by collecting footage of his public speeches from platforms such as Twitter and YouTube.

Despite its advantages, the TwoStreamVAN architecture has three notable limitations. First, it lacks semantic awareness, making it less effective at handling complex scenes involving multiple interacting objects. Second, it struggles to generate long video sequences—typically beyond five seconds—due to its limited temporal memory. Third, it does not support audio generation, which can reduce the perceived realism of the resulting video clips.
