## Absorption

When the light hits an object, it's either reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. The design of 

+ **Luminescence** - material emits light from excitation other than heating. The excitation can be either light, chemical reaction, or organic metabolism
	+ **Photoluminescence** - excited by light / photon
		+ **Fluorescence** 
		+ **Phosphe**

Fluorescence Detector

## Scattering

+ **Scattering** - changing of light propagation direction and energy
	+ **Elastic Scattering** - changing of 
		+ 
	+ **Inelastic / Raman Scattering** -
