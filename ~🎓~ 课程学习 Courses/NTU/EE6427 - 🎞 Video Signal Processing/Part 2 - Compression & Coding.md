+ **Goal** - Reduce the bits used to represent certain information
+ **Compression Ratio** - Size before compressed / Size after compressed

## Entropy of Information Source

+ Information Source $S=\{s_1, s_2, s_3, ..., s_n\}$
+ Probability of $s_i$ happening $p_i$
+ Entropy
$$\eta=H(s)$$
Entropy represent the smallest bits require to describe the information source.

## Huffman Coding

+ Frequency Based - Shorter Code for higher frequency patterns
