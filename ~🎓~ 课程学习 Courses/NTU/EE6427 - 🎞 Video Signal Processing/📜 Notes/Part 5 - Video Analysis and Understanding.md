Video Understanding is the process of extracting desired contents and information from the video. Here we will cover three topics of video understanding. Nowadays, most state-of-the-art video analysis algorithms make use of AI technologies.

## Object Detection

Object detection algorithms are fundamental of most video understanding tasks. It recognizes an object in an image or a video and marks it with a bounding box

The process is also called **Prediction** in the context of machine learning.
