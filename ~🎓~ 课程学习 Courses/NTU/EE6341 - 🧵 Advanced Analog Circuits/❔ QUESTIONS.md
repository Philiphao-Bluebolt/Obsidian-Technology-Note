## Low Noise Circuit Design

> [!FAQ] In the noise PSD definition formula $\overline{x^2}(f)=\overline{X^2}/\Delta f$, $\overline{X^2}$ is a variable and $\Delta f$ is a constant. How can their division become a function?
> Actually, the PSD $\overline{x^2}(f)$ is decided by the circuit parameters, such as resistor value, temperature or bias current, depending on their noise type. So, the PSD could be a function of frequency or a constant depending on the expression of the noise type. If the PSD is a function, then the MS $\overline{X^2}$ will be a function.


+ When two noise combine, why does $\overline{v_1 v_2}=0$ ?


+ As burst, Flicker and Shot Noise not related to resistance, they only have current form. Is that right?

+ Why is $C_\mu$ ignored in the BJT noise model?
