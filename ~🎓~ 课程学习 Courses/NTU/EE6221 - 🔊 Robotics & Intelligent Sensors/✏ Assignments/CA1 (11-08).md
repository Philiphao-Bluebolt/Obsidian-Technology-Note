## Writing

Soft robotics is a emerging subfield of robotics that focuse on the design, fabrication and control of robots that're partially or completely composed of compliant materials. Although the structures and control techniques of soft robot are far from being developed, many believes that soft robots have a bright future and will eventually become the next generation of robots.

Owing to their flexibility and compliance, soft robots have many advantages that rigid robots don't have. Here're three points.

Firstly, soft robots are safer for humans to cooperate with. Traditionally, it's dangerous and even lethal to stay around large moving robots beacuse crashing with the moving parts is likely to cause several harms. However, if the robot is completely made of soft material, the shock caused by the collision will be absorbed, protecting both the man and the robot and making it safe to work around a soft robot.

Secondly, soft robots are convenient to transport and store due to their deformability. As soft material can be compressed into smaller volume and likely non-metallic with lighter weight than rigid ones, soft robots can be easily carried around. 

Thirdly, soft robots are capable of entering or reaching into small and narrow space. In many scenarios such as rescue and archaeological excavation, there exists narrow and often curly space which is out of reach for humans and rigid robots. But when it comes to soft robots, it won't be a problem anymore. Soft robots can simply fit their flexible manipulators into the crack, bringing food to the trapped or inspecting the closed space.

There's two significant topics regarding the design of soft robotics, actuation mechanism and control strategy. Actuation mechanism determines the type of material and energy field that is required for the robot to move. Control strategy determines the design and implementation of control algorithms that move the robot following a desired pattern. In the following sections, we will discuss the two topics seperately.

The state-of-the-art soft robot prototypes developed by laboratories and innovation companies mainly use three types of actuation mechanism, fludic-driven, electric-driven and magnetic-driven.

Fludic-driven means to move the robot pneumatically or hydraulically exploiting the fludic pressure. As both air and liquid pressure are traditionally used in industry, this method relys little on novel material and lower the difficulty of fabrication. Another advantage is that the compressed liquid produces a large pushing force that is capable of raising up heavy loads. 

In 2019, NASA supported a program leading by engineers from Brigham Young University aiming to develop inflatable robots that are not easy to damage in space mission. They installed small air chambers on robot arms imitating human muscles. When the air chamber is inflated, the air inside drags the robot arm around. The position of the robot grabber can be controlled by adjusting the air pressure in different chambers.

Electric-driven and magnetic-driven actuations exploit the unique electrical effects of several novel materials such as DEA, ER Fluid, electroadhesive devices and MR Fluid. Take ER Fluid as example. The term stands for electrorheological fluid which are suspensions that contain electrically active particles. When placed inside a electric field, the viscosity of ER Fluid would greatly increase and thus produce pulling force. However, the main drawback of this two types of driven method is that they struggle with producing large force.

When building a soft robot, control system is equally important as the actuation system. To model the kinematic characteristic of the compliant structures, researchers apply the idea of calculus to the soft materials and describe them as finite serial sections, which is called piecewise constant curvature assumption. The PCC model doesn't accurately capture all the characteristic of soft structure but is widely used for its simplicity. After modeling, low-level control is usually implemented by pressure transducers and strain sensors.

Despite the solution variety of control and actuation, the field of soft robots still face several universal challenges. Firstly, the complexity of soft robot models makes the computation and control operation time-consuming. Secondly, the innovation of soft robot greatly relys on the discovery of new material. Thirdly, soft materials are difficult to drive a heavy payload. Lastly, it's hard to precisely and accurately control soft structures because their complex mechanical properties and low resistance to disturbance.

In my opinion, the future generations of soft robots should combine and fludic-driven and electric-driven. It can use traditional pneumatic and hydraulic actuation to yield a large driving force and integrate novel electric and magnetic materials actuators to enhance the accuracy. 

For the review, I consider it essential to encourage students to self-driven studying. The review did greatly inspire me in the field of robotics and make me more interesting in it because it helps me learn much about the frontier technology of robot, just like soft robots. After finishing this review, I understand that the charm of robotics is to combine every theory and technology in the family of STEM and explore the infinite possible of automation. Actually, I always wish to pursue a research career in robots.
