## About the Course

This course covers the analysis and design of linear multivariable systems. In order to keep it simple and efficient, not all linear system design methods would be introduced. The **state space representation** of a system is mostly used in the textbook, while the rational transfer function representation is downplayed.

+ ✅️ State-space Method 
+ ✅️ Polynomial Fraction Method
+ ❌️ Rational Fractions Method
+ ❌️ Geometric Approach
+ ❌️ Abstract Algebraic Approach
+ ❌️ Optimization

The systems discussed by the course are strictly lumped, casual and linear.

Control performances such as rise time, settling time, and overshoot are no considered since this is not strictly a control course.
