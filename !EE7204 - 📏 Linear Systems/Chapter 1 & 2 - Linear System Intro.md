## System Types

The study of a physical system consists of three steps: Modeling, Analysis, and Design. The first step, modeling yields a ideal mathematical model of the real system by first principles or collected data. The obtained model is usually refered to as the **system**. 

The system model can be categorized into different types based on their property:

+ 🧽 **Lumpedness** - Lumped <-> Distributed


### 🎱 Dynamicity

Dynamicity is the quality of having memory. **Dynamic System**s' output not only depends on the current input, but also the past or future input and state, implying memory. **Static System**s' output only depends on the current input.

Dynamic systems are described as **sequential** in digital electronics while static systems are described as **combinational** or **memoryless**

### ➡️ Causality

Causality is the quality of being logically feasible. **Acausal System**s' output relys on information of future states which is not allowed by the arrow of time, thus infeasible. **Causal System**s' output only depends on past or present state or input, thus feasible.

Static Systems are always casual since their output only depends on current input.

### 📏 Linearity

Linearity is the quality of complying with the superposition properties, which are 


### 🧽 Lumpedness



### ⏰️ Time Invariance

+  - Time-invariant (TI) <-> Time-varying (TV)
